# Data_scientist_question_Vertebral_column
Question, question, question everything, be skeptical and to make asks

# Objetive: 
<p> Implement and evaluate this approach on the Vertebral Column dataset from the UCI ML repository, There are two version, the version use will be which the orthopedic patients are categorized into three classes (disk hernia, spondylolisthesis, or normal</p>

## Goals
<li>

- Construct multiple desicion trees based on different partitions on the dataset into a training set and a test set. 

- Compare the structures and classification performance of these different trees

- For select trees, observer the classification performance associate with the different, classes, and determine which pair(s) of classes are likely to be confused to be confused with each other.

- For select confused class pairs in C., identify the corresponding leaf node(s), and analyze the sequence of decisions that lead to the misclassification
